View the running engine implementation at https://magikcraft.github.io/insulin-engine/

This engine integrates with a Minecraft plugin to provide a Virtual Reality experience of living with [Type 1 Diabetes](https://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/type-1-diabetes) for newly diagnosed children and families to understand the interaction of carbs, insulin, and Blood Glucose Levels; to experience community with others living with the condition; and for their friends and communities to understand what they live with and how to support them.
