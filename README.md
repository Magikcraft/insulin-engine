This engine integrates with a Minecraft plugin to provide a Virtual Reality experience of living with [Type 1 Diabetes](https://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/type-1-diabetes) for newly diagnosed children and families to understand the interaction of carbs, insulin, and Blood Glucose Levels; to experience community with others living with the condition; and for their friends and communities to understand what they live with and how to support them.

Project adviser [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) is a software developer, Type 1 Diabetic, and activist. In this video Scott describes what it is like to live with Type 1 Diabetes:
